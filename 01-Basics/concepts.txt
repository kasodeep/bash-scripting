There are two types of Shell:
	1. Interactive Shells: The one which directly executes the commands.
	2. Non-Interactive Shells: Executing the bash commands through the use of .sh files.

Types of Files:
	1. bash.sh: We can specify the extension to tell the OS to provide the file to scripts.
	2. bash: We need to move the file to a directory within our $PATH.

Mistakes:
	1. Forgetting to apply the persmission on the file, chmod +x name
	2. Understanding that sh and bash are distinct shells.

Importance of Quoting
	1. Weak: Uses double quotes: ""
	2. Strong: Uses single quotes: ''
